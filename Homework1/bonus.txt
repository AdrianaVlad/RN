similarities between cofactor and the provided formula for det A

the formula for det A can be rewritten as:
det(A) = a11*cof(a11) + a12*cof(a12) + a13*cof(a13)
where cof(aij) =  the cofactor of the element aij 

While the provided formula uses the first row and it's cofactors to calculate the determinant, we can achieve
the same det by using any row or any column of A. This is known as the Laplace expansion, or cofactor expansion.
